// Aim: Implement type inference.
//
// I have developed the lexer/parser in the past.
// However right now we need an end-to-end compiler that works.
// Thus without any delay we aim to implement the core language.
//
// Right now we just care about generating our bootstrap compiler.
// Performance does not matter for the bootstrap compiler thus we
// should try to write simple code without optimizing too much.
